[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

nefarium provides an API similar to OAuth for websites that do not support it.

## Installation

Docker is the preferred method of installation.

If you would not like to use Docker, you can install the package with poetry and run it in any shell.

```bash
poetry install . 
poetry run nefarium-start
```

## TODO

Highest priority first.

- [ ] Flow unit tests
- [ ] Pre-commit with tox (linting w/ black, typing w/ mypy, testing w/ pytest)
- [ ] Flow success cases (working on it)
- [ ] Premade flows for common sites (working on it)
- [ ] Public instance with heroku or repl.it (both?)
- [ ] Cloudflare challenges for ChatGPT & Discord

## Configuration

### Configuring the backend

Use the [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) to configure the nefarium backend on your server.

#### Environment Variables

| Variable Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Default                       |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **`NEFARIUM_MONGO_DB`**        | The MongoDB database to use for data storage. This is also respected by the configuration CLI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `nefarium`                    |
| **`NEFARIUM_MONGO_URI`**       | The MongoDB database instance URI to connect to and use for data storage. This is respected by the configuration CLI, but manually passing a CLI argument will supercede this setting.                                                                                                                                              | `mongodb://localhost:27017`   |                                                                                
| **`NEFARIUM_DEBUG`**           | If the `DEBUG` log level should be used over `INFO`. Unnecessary in production, but could be handy during setup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Unset (False)                 |
| **`NEFARIUM_PROXY`**           | Proxy to send requests data through. Should optimally be some rotating residential proxy like those provided by [Smartproxy](https://smartproxy.com), or one of your own creation. If a flow specifies a proxy, it will supercede this. <br/> *Due to a bug in authcaptureproxy, this may not always be used! Be careful of leaks!* | Attempts to read system proxy |
| **`NEFARIUM_DISCORD_WEBHOOK`** | A Discord webhook URL to send logging messages to using [`dislog`](https://github.com/regulad/dislog). ***Optional.***                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Unset                         |
| **`NEFARIUM_REDIS_URI`**       | The Redis URI to use for caching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `redis://localhost:6379`      |

### Adding login flows to your DB

You'll need to add a flow to the database before you can use it. Some example flows (as JSON files) are stored in [./examples/flows](./examples/flows).

## Testing

```bash
poetry install . -D

poetry run tox  # Runs pytest
poetry run tox -e lint  # Runs linter
poetry run tox -e type  # Runs Type checker
```
