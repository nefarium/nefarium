**nefarium-classic** provides an API similar to OAuth for websites that do not support it, letting you authenticate and make your own API middlemen.

nefarium classic uses a proxy-like interface for imitating a website to the user agent. This has a low performance overhead for the user, but a high performance overhead for nefarium. This is why nefarium classic is not recommended for high-traffic websites.

## Installation

Docker is the preferred method of installation.

If you would not like to use Docker, you can install the package with poetry and run it in any shell.

```bash
poetry install --only main
poetry run nefarium
```

## Configuration

### Configuring the backend

Use the [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) to configure the nefarium backend on your server.

| **`NEFARIUM_HOST`**            | The host to bind the HTTP server to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `0.0.0.0`                     |

| **`NEFARIUM_MONGO_DB`**        | The MongoDB database to use for data storage. This is also respected by the configuration CLI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `nefarium`                    |
| **`NEFARIUM_MONGO_URI`**       | The MongoDB database instance URI to connect to and use for data storage. This is respected by the configuration CLI, but manually passing a CLI argument will supercede this setting.                                                                                                                                              | `mongodb://localhost:27017`   |
| **`NEFARIUM_DEBUG`**           | If the `DEBUG` log level should be used over `INFO`.

| **`NEFARIUM_PROXY`**           | Proxy to send requests data through. Should optimally be some rotating residential proxy like those provided by [Smartproxy](https://smartproxy.com), or one of your own creation. If a flow specifies a proxy, it will supercede this. <br/> *Due to a bug in authcaptureproxy, this may not always be used! Be careful of leaks!* | Attempts to read system proxy |
| **`NEFARIUM_DISCORD_WEBHOOK`** | A Discord webhook URL to send logging messages to using [`dislog`](https://github.com/regulad/dislog). ***Optional.***                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Unset                         |
| **`NEFARIUM_REDIS_URI`**       | The Redis URI to use for caching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `redis://localhost:6379`      |
